Defined engineering and customer requirements, designed for cost and manufacturability, created 3D printed prototypes, hosted design reviews with project stakeholders, and creating technical 2D drawings. Utilized 3D printers to prototype mutliple design iterations, before working with supplier to have final version manufactured at scale.

                        manufacturers the ability to quickly and efficiently test all PCB’s functionality before shipping them to HP.`
